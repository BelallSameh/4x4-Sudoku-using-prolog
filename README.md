# 4x4-Sudoku-using-prolog ðŸ§©

## Project Overview

The **4x4-Sudoku-using-prolog** project is a 4x4 Sudoku solver built using Prolog. It utilizes various functions to verify and solve Sudoku puzzles. The project involves artificial intelligence (AI) and implements three different searching algorithms to solve a 4x4 Sudoku puzzle.

## Repository Contents

- **Prolog Code**: Implementation of Sudoku solving algorithms in Prolog.
- **Documentation**: Detailed explanation of the solving algorithms and their implementations.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/BelallSameh/4x4-Sudoku-using-prolog.git
    cd 4x4-Sudoku-using-prolog
    ```

2. **Run the Prolog Program**:
    - Load the Prolog file (`Sudoku.pl`) in your Prolog interpreter.
    - Use the implemented predicates to solve or verify 4x4 Sudoku puzzles.

## Features

- **Sudoku Solver**: Solves 4x4 Sudoku puzzles using Prolog.
- **Verification Functions**: Verify the correctness of Sudoku solutions.
- **AI Algorithms**: Implements three different searching algorithms for solving Sudoku puzzles.
